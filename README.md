## Quadratic Equation

#### Steps involved in solving using formular method

1. Write down your equation
--  As this step implies, here you write down the quadratic question you want to solve which goes in the format of **ax2+bx+c=0** and our equation will be **6x2+ 4x + 5 = 0**

2. Write down your formula
--  Since we are using the formular method, in this step we'll write down the formular we want to use in solving the equation, which is **x = -b ± √b2-4ac / 2a**


3. Substitute the values in your equation with the letters in the equation
--  Now we are ready to solve it. At this stage we will change the letters **a,b and c** to the numbers in the equation we want to solve, so **a=6,b=4 and c=5** and we'll get **-2 ± √16-120 / 12** and then simplify it.


4. Solve for X using the addition operator first
--  Now after simplifying, we solve for **X** using the addition operator first which will give us the first value of **X**


5. Solve for X using the subtraction operator lastly
-- The final step is to repeat step **4**, but this time using the subtraction operator and we'll get our second answer

6. Your final answer
-- Now after going through the above steps, You should have two answers and our **X** is literally equal to any of the two answers we got.
